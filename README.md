## üåü Project Summary

**Custom Auth Login Builder** is a playful yet practical solution to showcase next-generation web authentication. It's built as a **Creative Authentication Prototype** that allows users to create and test new ways of signing in without relying on traditional methods like emails, passwords, or phone numbers. The login page builder serves as a visual framework to demonstrate these concepts.

### Key Concepts:

* **Creative Authentication**: Secure sign-in using Gestures, Doodles, or Mini-games.
* **No Traditional Credentials**: Fun, visual, and memorable authentication methods.
* **Showcase Tool**: The Login Page Builder is designed to demonstrate how these new auth methods can be seamlessly integrated.

    * **Emoji Auth**: Select a sequence of 4-6 emojis.
    * **Pattern Auth**: Draw a pattern on a 3x3 grid.
* **Customization & Export**:
    * Edit page title, subtitle, button text, colors, and logo.
    * Perform an **instant validation test** to ensure you remember your chosen method.
    * **One-click Save & Download** to get a `.zip` file containing a self-contained, ready-to-use login page (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).
